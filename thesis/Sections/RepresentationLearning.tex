The objective in representation learning is the following: given a set of N time series instances $\mathcal{X}=\{x_1, x_2, \dots, x_N\}$, learn a non-linear embedding function $f_\theta$ that maps from an observation to a representation $r_i$:
\[
f_\theta: x_i \to r_i
\]
The observation is of dimension $T \times F$, where $T$ is the sequence length, and $F$ is the feature dimension. The representation is of size $T$: $r_i = \{r_{i,1}, r_{i,2}, \dots, r_{i,T}\}$
