	abstract = {The Right to be Forgotten is part of the recently enacted General Data Protection Regulation ({GDPR}) law that affects any data holder that has data on European Union residents. It gives {EU} residents the ability to request deletion of their personal data, including training records used to train machine learning models. Unfortunately, Deep Neural Network models are vulnerable to information leaking attacks such as model inversion attacks which extract class information from a trained model and membership inference attacks which determine the presence of an example in a model's training data. If a malicious party can mount an attack and learn private information that was meant to be removed, then it implies that the model owner has not properly protected their user's rights and their models may not be compliant with the {GDPR} law. In this paper, we present two efficient methods that address this question of how a model owner or data holder may delete personal data from models in such a way that they may not be vulnerable to model inversion and membership inference attacks while maintaining model efficacy. We start by presenting a real-world threat model that shows that simply removing training data is insufficient to protect users. We follow that up with two data removal methods, namely Unlearning and Amnesiac Unlearning, that enable model owners to protect themselves against such attacks while being compliant with regulations. We provide extensive empirical analysis that show that these methods are indeed efficient, safe to apply, effectively remove learned information about sensitive data from trained models while maintaining model efficacy.},

	abstract = {Machine-learning ({ML}) algorithms are increasingly utilized in privacy-sensitive applications such as predicting lifestyle choices, making medical diagnoses, and facial recognition. In a model inversion attack, recently introduced in a case study of linear classifiers in personalized medicine by Fredrikson et al., adversarial access to an {ML} model is abused to learn sensitive genomic information about individuals. Whether model inversion attacks apply to settings outside theirs, however, is unknown. We develop a new class of model inversion attack that exploits confidence values revealed along with predictions. Our new attacks are applicable in a variety of settings, and we explore two in depth: decision trees for lifestyle surveys as used on machine-learning-as-a-service systems and neural networks for facial recognition. In both cases confidence values are revealed to those with the ability to make prediction queries to models. We experimentally show attacks that are able to estimate whether a respondent in a lifestyle survey admitted to cheating on their significant other and, in the other context, show how to recover recognizable images of people's faces given only their name and access to the {ML} model. We also initiate experimental exploration of natural countermeasures, investigating a privacy-aware decision tree training algorithm that is a simple variant of {CART} learning, as well as revealing only rounded confidence values. The lesson that emerges is that one can avoid these kinds of {MI} attacks with negligible degradation to utility.},

We focus on the basic membership inference attack: given a data record and black-box access to a model, determine if the record was in the model's training dataset. To perform membership inference against a target model, we make adversarial use of machine learning and train our own inference model to recognize differences in the target model's predictions on the inputs that it trained on versus the inputs that it did not train on. We empirically evaluate our inference techniques on classification models trained by commercial "machine learning as a service" providers such as Google and Amazon. Using realistic datasets and classification tasks, including a hospital discharge dataset whose membership is sensitive from the privacy perspective, we show that these models can be vulnerable to membership inference attacks. We then investigate the factors that influence this leakage and evaluate mitigation strategies.},

	abstract = {Recent work has demonstrated substantial gains on many {NLP} tasks and benchmarks by pre-training on a large corpus of text followed by fine-tuning on a specific task. While typically task-agnostic in architecture, this method still requires task-specific fine-tuning datasets of thousands or tens of thousands of examples. By contrast, humans can generally perform a new language task from only a few examples or from simple instructions - something which current {NLP} systems still largely struggle to do. Here we show that scaling up language models greatly improves task-agnostic, few-shot performance, sometimes even reaching competitiveness with prior state-of-the-art fine-tuning approaches. Specifically, we train {GPT}-3, an autoregressive language model with 175 billion parameters, 10x more than any previous non-sparse language model, and test its performance in the few-shot setting. For all tasks, {GPT}-3 is applied without any gradient updates or fine-tuning, with tasks and few-shot demonstrations specified purely via text interaction with the model. {GPT}-3 achieves strong performance on many {NLP} datasets, including translation, question-answering, and cloze tasks, as well as several tasks that require on-the-fly reasoning or domain adaptation, such as unscrambling words, using a novel word in a sentence, or performing 3-digit arithmetic. At the same time, we also identify some datasets where {GPT}-3's few-shot learning still struggles, as well as some datasets where {GPT}-3 faces methodological issues related to training on large web corpora. Finally, we find that {GPT}-3 can generate samples of news articles which human evaluators have difficulty distinguishing from articles written by humans. We discuss broader societal impacts of this finding and of {GPT}-3 in general.},

Through an enormous experimental effort1–4, the structures of around 100,000 unique proteins have been determined5, but this represents a small fraction of the billions of known protein sequences6,7. Structural coverage is bottlenecked by the months to years of painstaking effort required to determine a single protein structure. Accurate computational approaches are needed to address this gap and to enable large-scale structural bioinformatics. Predicting the three-dimensional structure that a protein will adopt based solely on its amino acid sequence—the structure prediction component of the ‘protein folding problem’8—has been an important open research problem for more than 50 years9. Despite recent progress10–14, existing methods fall far short of atomic accuracy, especially when no homologous structure is available. Here we provide the first computational method that can regularly predict protein structures with atomic accuracy even in cases in which no similar structure is known. We validated an entirely redesigned version of our neural network-based model, {AlphaFold}, in the challenging 14th Critical Assessment of protein Structure Prediction ({CASP}14)15, demonstrating accuracy competitive with experimental structures in a majority of cases and greatly outperforming other methods. Underpinning the latest version of {AlphaFold} is a novel machine learning approach that incorporates physical and biological knowledge about protein structure, leveraging multi-sequence alignments, into the design of the deep learning algorithm.},

	abstract = {Representation learning for time series has been an important research area for decades. Since the emergence of the foundation models, this topic has attracted a lot of attention in contrastive self-supervised learning, to solve a wide range of downstream tasks. However, there have been several challenges for contrastive time series processing. First, there is no work considering noise, which is one of the critical factors affecting the efficacy of time series tasks. Second, there is a lack of efficient yet lightweight encoder architectures that can learn informative representations robust to various downstream tasks. To fill in these gaps, we initiate a novel sampling strategy that promotes consistent representation learning with the presence of noise in natural time series. In addition, we propose an encoder architecture that utilizes dilated convolution within the Inception block to create a scalable and robust network architecture with a wide receptive field. Experiments demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in forecasting, classification, and abnormality detection tasks, e.g. ranks first over two-thirds of the classification {UCR} datasets, with only \$40{\textbackslash}\%\$ of the parameters compared to the second-best approach.

We conduct extensive experiments on time series classification tasks to evaluate the quality of time series representations. As a result, {TS}2Vec achieves significant improvement over existing {SOTAs} of unsupervised time series representation on 125 {UCR} datasets and 29 {UEA} datasets. The learned timestamp-level representations also achieve superior results in time series forecasting and anomaly detection tasks. A linear regression trained on top of the learned representations outperforms previous {SOTAs} of time series forecasting. Furthermore, we present a simple way to apply the learned representations for unsupervised anomaly detection, which establishes {SOTA} results in the literature.

	abstract = {Unsupervised/self-supervised representation learning in time series is critical since labeled samples are usually scarce in real-world scenarios. Existing approaches mainly leverage the contrastive learning framework, which automatically learns to understand the similar and dissimilar data pairs. Nevertheless, they are restricted to the prior knowledge of constructing pairs, cumbersome sampling policy, and unstable performances when encountering sampling bias. Also, few works have focused on effectively modeling across temporal-spectral relations to extend the capacity of representations. In this paper, we aim at learning representations for time series from a new perspective and propose Cross Reconstruction Transformer ({CRT}) to solve the aforementioned problems in a unified way. {CRT} achieves time series representation learning through a cross-domain dropping-reconstruction task. Specifically, we transform time series into the frequency domain and randomly drop certain parts in both time and frequency domains. Dropping can maximally preserve the global context compared to cropping and masking. Then a transformer architecture is utilized to adequately capture the cross-domain correlations between temporal and spectral information through reconstructing data in both domains, which is called Dropped Temporal-Spectral Modeling. To discriminate the representations in global latent space, we propose Instance Discrimination Constraint to reduce the mutual information between different time series and sharpen the decision boundaries. Additionally, we propose a specified curriculum learning strategy to optimize the {CRT}, which progressively increases the dropping ratio in the training process.},

In this paper, we propose an unsupervised Time-Series representation learning framework via Temporal and Contextual Contrasting ({TS}-{TCC}), to learn time-series representation from unlabeled data.

Second, we propose a novel temporal contrasting module to learn robust temporal representations by designing a tough cross-view prediction task. Last, to further learn discriminative representations, we propose a contextual contrasting module built upon the contexts from the temporal contrasting module. It attempts to maximize the similarity among different contexts of the same sample while minimizing similarity among contexts of different samples. Experiments have been carried out on three real-world time-series datasets.

	shorttitle = {Exploring the Landscape of Machine Unlearning},
	abstract = {Machine unlearning ({MU}) is gaining increasing attention due to the need to remove or modify predictions made by machine learning ({ML}) models. While training models have become more efficient and accurate, the importance of unlearning previously learned information has become increasingly significant in fields such as privacy, security, and fairness. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of {MU}, covering current state-of-the-art techniques and approaches, including data deletion, perturbation, and model updates. In addition, commonly used metrics and datasets are also presented. The paper also highlights the challenges that need to be addressed, including attack sophistication, standardization, transferability, interpretability, training data, and resource constraints. The contributions of this paper include discussions about the potential benefits of {MU} and its future directions. Additionally, the paper emphasizes the need for researchers and practitioners to continue exploring and refining unlearning techniques to ensure that {ML} models can adapt to changing circumstances while maintaining user trust. The importance of unlearning is further highlighted in making Artificial Intelligence ({AI}) more trustworthy and transparent, especially with the increasing importance of {AI} in various domains that involve large amounts of personal user data.},
